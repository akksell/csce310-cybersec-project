# Project Overview:
The Cybersecurity Center Student Tracking and Reporting Tool is a database management system designed to streamline the Texas A&M Cybersecurity Center (TAMCC) data management process. The center aims to support the development of future cyber leaders through specialized training in critical technology areas for national defense, which is accomplished by many of our programs.

# Objectives:
The primary goals of this tool are to centralize, organize, and efficiently manage center program information, as well as automate the reporting process to meet regulatory requirements. It will also provide an interactive portal for students to input their data, track progress, and access program resources.

# Key Features:

Each key feature must demonstrate the ability to insert, update, delete, and select. 

In addition, each team member must demonstrate using the four commands and implement an index and view. Each key feature must have an admin and student side. 

## User Authentication and Roles:
1. Admin reporting will be supported (E.g., attendance of different events).
2. Admin Panel: Allows program administrators to manage and analyze data.
3. Student Portal: Enables students to log in, update information, and track program progress.

## Student Information Management:

### Website Registration
Site must have a form of login/application system

### Program Applications 

Students can be a part of multiple programs. The tracking system should also allow new programs to be added.

- Cyber Leader Development Program (CLDP)
- Virtual Institutes for Cyber and Electromagnetic Spectrum Research and Employ (VICEROY)
- Pathways
- CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
- DoD Cybersecurity Scholarship Program (CySP)

### Program Requirement Reporting & Tracking
- CLDP
- Virtual Institutes for Cyber and Electromagnetic Spectrum Research and Employ (VICEROY)
- Pathways
- CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service (SFS)
 - DoD Cybersecurity Scholarship Program (CySP)


Capture and store data from application forms, including personal details, academic information, and program preferences.

## Program Progress Tracking:

Record and track student progress within the TAMCC's programs, including course enrollments, certifications, and initiatives pursued.

## Document Upload and Management:

Allow students to upload resumes and other documents for program opportunities.

## Reporting and Analytics:

Generate reports on various programs and their metrics, such as total VICEROY students, completion rates, participation in specific courses, and more.

# Data to be Tracked: 

The system will manage the following data points:
- UIN
- First Name
- Last Name
- Middle Initial
- Gender
- Hispanic or Latino
- Race, U.S. Citizen
- First Time Generation College Student 
- DoB
- Phone
- Email
- Discord username

Academic details:
- School
- Classification
- Expected Graduation
- Major
- Major #2
- Minor
- Minor #2
- GPA

Program affiliations:
- ROTC
- Corps of Cadets
- Cybersecurity Club
- Women in Cybersecurity


Certification and course information
1. Are you currently enrolled in other uncompleted certifications sponsored by the Cybersecurity Center? 

    - If yes, which certificate? (The Cybersecurity Center provides a training course for each of the certifications, so the status of the completion of their training is tracked. So, in-progress or complete are the statuses of their training.)


2. Are you currently receiving and part of the following Cybersecurity Center Programs? 
    - Just being able to provide details about all the cybersecurity programs a student must be a part of.

3. Have you completed any cybersecurity industry certifications via the Cybersecurity Center? (examples: CompTIA Security+, EC Council of Certified Ethical Hackers, etc.) 
    - If you answered yes to the prior question, which certifications did you complete and when? (This is separate from the training).
    - Have they passed the certificate, or have they failed the certification? 
    - Also, note that a student can only apply a certification to one program. **They cannot double dip**.

4. Which initiative (The initiatives are the courses, certifications, and internships. So, when a student starts a semester, they will make known the initiatives they seek to complete.) are you pursuing through [_Program_] this semester? 
    - This is reporting each semester what certification or class each student is seeking after?
        
        - Certifications and cyber-related degrees.
        - Cyber-related to degree or minor 
          - Essentially providing data if there are changes to your major(s) or minor(s).
        - Foreign language Classes.
        - Classes focused on the mathematical foundations of cryptography.
        - Classes related to data science.
5. **(This is specifically for the application process.)** Please write a brief purpose statement describing how you will apply your cyber expertise to benefit the United States federal government if you are selected for participation in the [_Program_] program.

**Certifications are the only thing that cannot be doubled dipped within each program. This means that if a student is in two programs, CLDP and VICEROY, and they complete Security+ certification, they cannot count it towards both programs.**

**But if they take a class or get an internship, they can count it to both programs. At the beginning of the semester, when they decide on the initiatives they are seeking, they must request identifying what program the certification will be assigned too.**

# Reporting Questions that need to be answered:

Program progress statements and resumes

## Reporting Metrics (This is for all programs): 

The tool will generate reports on metrics such as total students, completion rates, course preferences, and more in compliance with government agency reporting requirements.

- Number of total [Progam] students
- Number of students to complete all course and certification opportunities.
- Number of students electing to take additional strategic foreign language courses.
- The number of students electing to take other cryptography and cryptographic mathematics courses.
- Number of students electing to carry additional data science and related courses.
- Number of students to enroll in DoD 8570.01M preparation training courses.
- Number of students to complete DoD 8570.01M preparation training courses.
- Number of students to complete a DoD 8570.01M certification examination.
- Minority participation 
- The number of K-12 students enrolled in summer camps.
    - Each program has summer camps. The students are applying to be a part of the summer camps.
- Number of students pursuing federal internships
    - The tracking system tracks what internships students have applied to, which ones they were accepted to, which ones they did not get accepted to, and which ones they took. This is supposed to be tracked yearly.
- Student majors 
- Student internship locations

# Conclusion: 

The TAMCC Student Tracking and Reporting Tool will serve as a centralized platform to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the TAMCC's programs. 

Automating data management and reporting will provide valuable insights and streamline administrative tasks, ultimately contributing to the development of future cyber leaders for national defense.
